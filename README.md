## Interests

I’ve always had a passion for tech, from games consoles to computers, mobile phones to high-end audio equipment,
and then programming. I like learning about the latest available technology and gadgets through reviews on YouTube
and Google. I’m a big fan of logic, figuring out how and why things work as they do, and investigating possible ways to
make them work better. This has led to a deepening interest in programming and a determination to build a career in
the field of technology.
